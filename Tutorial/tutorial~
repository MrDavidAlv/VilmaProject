Tutorial:
1- Install ROS, a quick google search leads to http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu, get the sources.list for yout ubuntu version. I'll be using 12.04 here since it's the current long term supported version. 

I used the sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list' Command. 
 
I also installed the key : wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add - 

This website guides one through the groovy version of ros installation. However there is a more recent version of it, called hydro. It was released very recently, august. So I used :

sudo apt-get get update ;
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full

to install it, analogous to the command given in the website. 
 This installation is a big one and should take a while. 

After it's done installing make sure it is updated (sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get upgrade) and open your ~/.bashrc file(gedit ~/.bashrc) and add "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash".


and here I put "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" at the end a the file (in a new line).

test the program, open a new terminal and type roscore. It should work.
Close it and proceed to the gazebo installation.


2- Install Gazebo, a similar google search leads to http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.9/install#Pre-compiled_binaries. Bear in mind once again that I'll be using the 12.04 ubuntu version here.

 Setting the source.list 

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-latest.list'


Getting the key : wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

Preparing to install Gazebo:

sudo apt-get update;
sudo apt-get upgrade

installing:

sudo apt-get install gazebo

for some reason it said it was already installed here, maybe it comes with the hydro version of ros, but try installing it just to be sure. 

After that, run gzserver so it gets the necessary models to initialize.
 It exited here with and error, but I followed http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/1213/cannot-connect-to-connection-manager/
 and deleted the "localhost" from the etc/hosts in line ::1 still didn't solve, so I rebooted the pc and then it was solved. After 
running gzserver exit.

 By now you should be able to open gazebo with "gazebo" in the terminal with no error.

3- Installing the car and plugins: 
 
 Copy the vilma_draw and vilma_vehicle to the ~/.gazebo/models .
 You should now be able to open the vehicle in the gazebo insert tab, but only the draw one, since the vilma_vehicle uses the plugins not yet installed.
 Now copy the libvilma_ros_plugin.so to the /usr/lib/gazebo-1.9/plugins
 and libVilma2Plugin.so to /usr/lib/gazebo-1.8/plugins(create the folders) (because libvilma_ros_plugin.so tries to load libVilma2Plugin.so from this path, I need to fix this).
 Now put the my_world.world file in your home directory. You can put it another where but then you will be more thoublesome. 
 Now copy all content of the folder environments to the ~/.gazebo/models. This content regards the world model files.
 
 Now type : roscore in one terminal and let it run and in another one type gazebo -s libgazebo_ros_api_plugin.so my_world.world 
 it should open with the world and vehicle .
 Now it is all installed. Moving on to the controlling the vehicle part:

 in order to use the gui tool you (as of today, I plan on trying to change that) need to install a program QT, you can get it here http://qt-project.org/downloads, I used the online version for 64 bits. After it's installed just run in a terminal the vilma_controler file using ./vilma_controler in it's directory.

 The command line version it a lot simpler, just execute it in a terminal.
